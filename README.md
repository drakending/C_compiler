# C compiler
this is a C compiler with rust implementation.

- [√] Lexer
- [√] Parser
- [√] Evaluator(which interpreted the AST like script language, helps to check the grammar correctness when the IR generator unfinished.)
- [] IR Generator
- [] Machine code Generator

current support features:
* simple calculation (add, subtract, multipy, devide)
* var declaration(simple declaration or declaration with init)
* var assignment

next things want to do:
* array support (like C) (without initilization first)
* condition control
